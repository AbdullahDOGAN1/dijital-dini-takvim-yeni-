PLACEHOLDER for compass background image (compass_bg.png)

This should be a circular compass background image showing:
- Cardinal directions (N, S, E, W)
- Intermediate directions (NE, NW, SE, SW)  
- Degree markings around the edge
- Traditional compass styling with gold/bronze colors
- Size: 300x300 pixels minimum
- Format: PNG with transparent background

For now, we'll use a programmatically drawn compass background.
